4. Player moves to new position
5. Special space effects are applied (if any)
6. If doubles were rolled:
   - Player can choose "End Turn" or "Roll Again"
   - If "Roll Again" is chosen, repeat from step 2
   - If "End Turn" is chosen, turn ends
7. If no doubles, turn automatically ends
8. Next player's turn begins

### Special Cases

#### Jail Turn Flow
1. Player in jail can choose:
   - Pay $50 fine (if they have the money)
   - Use jail card (if they have one)
   - Roll for doubles
2. If they choose to roll and don't get doubles:
   - Turn ends immediately
   - Player stays in jail
3. If they get doubles or use other methods:
   - Player escapes jail
   - Normal turn flow continues

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Components

### Button Layout
- **Vertical Layout**: All action buttons are arranged vertically for better visibility
- **Consistent Styling**: All buttons use the same `UniformButton` component with consistent styling
- **Color Coding**:
  - Default (purple): Roll Dice
  - Blue: Roll Again
  - Red: End Turn
  - Green: Buy Property, Use Jail Card
  - Purple: Auction, Roll for Doubles

### Button Visibility Logic
- **Roll Dice**: Only shown when it's player's turn and they can roll
- **End Turn**: Shown when player can end turn (after doubles or normal turn end)
- **Roll Again**: Only shown when player rolled doubles and can roll again
- **Jail Actions**: Only shown when player is in jail

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### State Management
- `currentPlayerIndex`: Tracks current player turn
- `gamePhase`: Manages game state ('waiting', 'rolling', 'moving', 'turn-end')
- `playerStatuses`: Tracks jail and vacation status for each player
- `playerDoublesCount`: Tracks consecutive doubles for each player
- `canRollAgain`: Boolean flag for double roll state

### Key Functions
- `handleRollDice()`: Manages dice rolling and movement
- `handleEndTurn()`: Manages turn transitions
- `handleMovementLogic()`: Handles movement and special space effects
- `canPlayerRoll()`: Determines if player can roll dice

### Event Handling
- Dice roll results trigger movement and special effects
- Button clicks trigger appropriate game actions
- Turn transitions handle player order and special status effects
